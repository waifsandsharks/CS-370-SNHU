CS-370-H5862 Current/Emerging Trends in CS

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In project two I wrote code that addressed creating each episode, epoch loops, when it was appropriate to switch between a random move or the quality algorithm, when to reference the actions taken in the neural network to use in later episodes and the win and loss states. Project two came loaded with both the Keras and dependent libraries in addition to model structure used in the neural network. Additionally, it was loaded with controllers for the default variables that the model parameters and the number of episodes use to initiate the treasure hunter program.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
As I computer scientist I work to create solutions that are both intuitive and efficient in benefiting mankind with the use of computers. Though this course I have worked to expand my knowledge of Ai and how it fits into the future of the growing computer science field. With this knowledge I can bring automation and simplicity to computer programs by implementing AI in future projects. These solutions are important as they affect not just me, the creator of these software, but the people who interact with them as well. Considering this I have learned how regulations such as the EU's GDPR protect people and their data that would be used with an AI like this.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist I approach solving a problem by asking how I can improve this, how does my solution work to benefit others, are there other solutions that work better, and is my solution ethical. By asking these questions I can ensure that that what I’m doing is right, beneficial to everyone, and not ethically harmful. 

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
With regulations put in place like the EU's GDPR, the protection of people’s data and how it’s used is an ethical responsibility of everyone in a computer science role. As a computer scientist, protecting a user’s best interests is just as important as writing useful code. Afterall if you can’t write code that protects people a user who are you writing code for? Ethics are especially important when working with a user’s data, for example data should only be used on a as needed basis, anonymized when available, and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
